Hi <%= @existing_parent.first_name %>,

We wanted to inform you that a new parent/guardian has been added to your student's account:

STUDENT:
========

Name: <%= @student.first_name %> <%= @student.last_name %>
Grade: <%= @student.grade_display %>
<% if @student.favorite_pokemon.present? -%>
Favorite Pokémon: <%= @student.favorite_pokemon %>
<% end -%>

NEW PARENT/GUARDIAN:
===================

Name: <%= @new_parent.first_name %> <%= @new_parent.last_name %>
Email: <%= @new_parent.email_address %>
Role: <%= @new_parent.role.humanize %>

This parent/guardian will now receive club notifications and can access <%= @student.first_name %>'s club information.

If you have any questions about this change, please contact the club administrators.

Best regards,
The <%= @club_name %> Team
