PARENT ACCOUNT UPDATE - <%= @club_name %>

Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,

We wanted to notify you about a change to your student's account access.

Student: <%= @student.full_name %>
Removed Parent: <%= @unlinked_parent.full_name %>

Another parent/guardian has been REMOVED from <%= @student.first_name %>'s account. This parent will no longer receive updates about <%= @student.first_name %>'s club activities.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
- Your access to <%= @student.first_name %>'s information remains unchanged
- You will continue to receive all club notifications for <%= @student.first_name %>
- The removed parent will no longer get club-related emails
- This change was made by a club administrator

If you have any questions about this change, please contact the club administrators.

Thank you for being part of our Pok√©mon club community!

Best regards,
<%= @club_name %>
