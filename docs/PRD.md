# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Lake Elementary School Pokemon Club Website

**Project Name:** Lake Elementary Pokemon Club Website
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** September 7, 2025
**Author:** Rodney Gauna
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Lake Elementary School Pokemon Club website will serve as a centralized digital hub for club communication, donor recognition, and resource management. Built as a Ruby on Rails 8 web application, the site will address critical communication gaps between club leadership and parents while showcasing community support and providing easy access to important club resources. The application will feature user authentication, content management capabilities, email notifications, and robust data management through Active Record and Active Storage.
